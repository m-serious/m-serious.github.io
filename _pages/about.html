My research is centered on pushing the boundaries of what Large Language Models (LLMs) can achieve, with a focus on building more capable, general, and responsible AI agents through advanced Reinforcement Learning.</p> <p>My recent achievement is leading the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13508" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Time-R1</a> project, where my novel RL framework empowered a 3B model to outperform models 200x larger on challenging temporal reasoning benchmarks. This work underscores my expertise in creating highly efficient training pipelines that prioritize sophistication over sheer scale.</p> <p>My experience also includes: • Architecting general-purpose agent frameworks like <a href="https://github.com/FoundationAgents/OpenManus" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">OpenManus</a> to enhance strategic planning and generalization. • Integrating robust safety and ethical layers into AI scientist agents through the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23559" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">SafeScientist</a> framework. • Designing <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22961" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">persuasive agents</a> with Theory of Mind to improve their interaction capabilities.</p> <p>Core Competencies: • Agentic AI: Reasoning, Planning, Memory, Generalization • Reinforcement Learning: Online/Offline RL, Reward Engineering, Curriculum Learning • LLM Specializations: Multimodality (LVLM), Temporal Reasoning, Persuasive AI, AI Safety</p> <p>I am passionate about engaging with fellow researchers and practitioners. I am always open to discussing new research, challenges, and potential collaborations!</p> <p><span style="color: red;">I will be on the job market starting in Winter 2026. If you believe I might be a good fit for your institution or organization, I’d love to connect!</span></p> </body></html>
